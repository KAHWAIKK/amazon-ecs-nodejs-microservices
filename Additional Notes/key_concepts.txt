 Create the monolith AWS Copilot Service
A Copilot Service runs containers. Internet-facing services can be a Request-Driven Web Service that uses AWS App Runner or a Load Balanced Web Service that provisions an Application or Network Load Balancer with appropriate security groups, and runs on Amazon ECS or Fargate.

Other Service types include a Backend Service that lets AWS services communicate within the application but not to the Internet. A Worker Service is used for asynchronous service-to-service messaging with Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS).

This tutorial uses a Load Balanced Web Service for the Internet-facing monolith. To create the monolithic service, enter copilot svc init and choose Load Balanced Web Service.

‚úÖ 1. copilot app init
Initializes a new Copilot application.

Creates resources like ECR repos, IAM roles, and S3 buckets.

Sets up a local configuration directory.
üìÅ Example:

bash
Copy
Edit
copilot app init


‚úÖ 2. copilot env init
Creates a new environment (e.g., dev, staging, prod).

Provisions a VPC, ECS Cluster, Subnets, Load Balancer, IAM roles.

Stores environment settings in a manifest file.
üìÅ Example:

bash
Copy
Edit
copilot env init


‚úÖ 3. copilot env deploy --name <env-name>
Deploys the previously initialized environment.

Sets up networking, DNS, security groups, internet access, etc.
üìÅ Example:

bash
Copy
Edit
copilot env deploy --name api


‚úÖ 4. copilot svc init
Creates a Copilot service (like a containerized web app).

Prompts for workload type (e.g., Load Balanced Web Service).

Links to your Dockerfile to define the container.
üìÅ Example:

bash
Copy
Edit

copilot svc init
‚úÖ 5. copilot svc deploy --name <service-name>
Deploys a service to the specified environment.

Builds Docker image locally.

Pushes image to ECR.

Provisions ECS Service, Load Balancer, IAM roles, etc.
üìÅ Example:

bash
Copy
Edit
copilot svc deploy --name monolith


These five commands are the core steps to deploy a containerized application with AWS Copilot, going from setup to live deployment.
